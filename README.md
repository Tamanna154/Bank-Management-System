# Bank-Management-System
The Bank Management System project demonstrates a foundational understanding of object
oriented programming in Java, emphasizing practical application in a banking context. The project organizes functionality into classes that represent different types of accounts (SavingsAccount and FixedDepositAccount).Key Features:

• Account Management: 
    Users can create, deposit into, withdraw from, and view accounts.The project uses text file storage (accounts.txt) for persistence, allowing account details to be saved and retrieved even 
    after the program exits. 

• Abstraction and Encapsulation:
    Core banking operations are encapsulated within classes,ensuring that critical daata  and methods are only accessed through defined interfaces. Abstract classes and methods allow for 
    extensibility, enabling different account types with varying behaviors. 
    
• Error Handling and Validation: 
     The project integrates basic validation for deposit and withdrawal transactions, ensuring that only valid amounts are processed. This contributes to a more user-friendly and robust system. 
     
• Investment Guide: 
      The system also provides an advisory feature to suggest account types based on balance and time, adding a user-oriented feature that enhances the program’s utility.
